# open bydata Bayern API Exploration Notebooks

## Introduction

This repository contains jupyter notebooks that demonstrate examples how the [portal's](https://opendata.bayern/home?locale=de) APIs can be used. Just clone the repository, open the jupyter notebooks and play with them.

## Example Notebooks

### 1. Search API

This notebook demonstrates the utilization of the portals search API. It does this by identifing the number of entries for a given filter term (e.g., Munich, Radweg). Have a look at the jupiter notebook: [get_number_of_entries](./notebooks/get_number_of_entries.ipynb)


### 2. Repo API

This notebook demonstrates the utilization of the portals repo API. It does this by identifing all datasets of entries for a given filter term (e.g., Munich, Radweg). Have a look at the jupiter notebook: [plot_baumkataster](./notebooks/plot_baumkataster.ipynb)
