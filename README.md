# open bydata Bayern API Exploration Notebooks

## Introduction

This repository contains jupyter notebooks that demonstrate examples how the [portal's](https://opendata.bayern/home?locale=de) APIs can be used. Feel free to clone the repository, open jupyter notebooks and have a play.

## Example Notebooks

### 1. Search API

This notebook demonstrates the utilization of the portal's search API. This is done by identifying the number of entries for a given filter term (e.g., Munich, Radweg). Have a look at the jupiter notebook: [get_number_of_entries](./notebooks/get_number_of_entries.ipynb)


### 2. Repo API

The second available Repo API is described in this notebook. This is again done by identifing all datasets of entries for a given filter term (e.g., Munich, Radweg). Have a look at the jupiter notebook: [plot_baumkataster](./notebooks/plot_baumkataster.ipynb)
